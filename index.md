GreenCodeAnalyzer is a **VS Code extension** designed to identify energy-inefficient patterns in Python code. It helps developers write more energy-efficient programs by detecting and suggesting optimizations for common inefficiencies. This tool aims to **shift energy efficiency concerns left**, meaning that developers can address performance and energy consumption issues earlier in the development process.

## Features

- **Static Energy Analysis** – Identifies inefficient code patterns without executing the program.
- **Visual Code Annotations** – Highlights inefficiencies directly in the VS Code editor.
- **Optimization Suggestions** – Provides actionable recommendations to improve energy efficiency.
- **Wide Rule Coverage** – Detects multiple types of energy-related inefficiencies in Python code.

## Visualization in VS Code

The **GreenCodeAnalyzer** provides visual feedback in the VS Code editor using:

- **Colored gutter icons** next to affected lines to indicate inefficiencies.
- **Hover tooltips** displaying rule descriptions and optimization suggestions.
- **Status bar notifications** summarizing detected issues.

By integrating seamlessly with the VS Code interface, this extension ensures that developers can quickly identify and fix inefficient code without leaving their workflow.
